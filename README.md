## Summary
This application will sync your Anilist.co anime list to your Myanimelist.com list. Simply enter your credentials and let it take care of the rest.

Ani2Mal remains in alpha phase. Use at your own risk!

## Technical
* Server Stack: Node, Express, Pug
* Client Side: Bulma CSS Framework
* Tests: Jest
* Hosting: running from a Docker image on now.sh

## Issues
Due to limitations of the Myanimelist API, a large number of shows are not matched. A future update to Anilist.co's API promises to alleviate this difficulty. This application will remain in alpha phase until that happens.
